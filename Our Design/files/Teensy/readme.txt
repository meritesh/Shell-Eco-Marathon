Teensy 2.0

Design Notes:

1) Vias are set to 0.04" drill size, and 0.074" pad size. Drill size should be no smaller than 0.038" to fit standard pins. 
2) Two smaller vias on Teensy ++ designed for wires, not for pins. Any attempt to manipulate them for usage with pins will result in a mismatch with the original Teensy ++ Footprint.
